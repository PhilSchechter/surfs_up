## Weather, Surfing and Ice Cream

### Purpose

Will the weather support a surfing shop that also sells ice cream?

We have collected weather reports from the weather stations on this island, and will look to see if the weather conditions are typically supportive of surfing and consuming ice cream. We have specificially been asked to look at the months of June and December in some detail.

### Some results

[June and December Temperature Stat](June_December_temps.png)

- June's avg temp is right around 75 farenheit degrees, while december is 4 degrees cooler on average. 
- The lowest quartertile temps top out at 73 in June and 69 in December - so most readings are above 70. These temperatures do not indicate a particular time of day - midday may be warmer.
- Maximum readings are in the low to mid 80's; excessive heat should not be an issue.

### Summary / further analysis
- earlier work started to look at precip levels - I expanded on this below
- **overall, both the temperatures and the precip levels seem conducive to the business proposed**

#### for further study

[Avg daily precip by month](daily_precip_by_month.png)
- the attached graph, set up in *Surfs_up_precip_bymonth.ipynb* shows avg daily precip by month: about 0.14 inches for June, 0.21 inches for December. It may pay to research further. For example, may only want to use readings from the station nearest to the proposed shop. Also, may want to see if the rain is clustered (e.g. a few rainy days, mostly sunshine) or if many days have a little bit of rain.
- May want to study incidence of severe events - e.g. storms with winds over 30mph may not encourage casual surfing
